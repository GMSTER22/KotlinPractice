# Overview

This software is a "Recipe Organizer Application". It allows users to manage their recipes. The user will be able to view, add, delete, and search recipes.

This project is my attempt to stretch my knowledge by learning enough about Kotlin to be able to build the present application and build the foundation to building mobile applications in the future by leveraging this language.
